            <H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
            <P>This website and underlying infrastructure has been put together by me over a few weeks, and is hosted on a 
            virtual server. I am working on improving it, but it is likely to have a few glitches for now. 
            Also, I am reliant on data that ultimately comes from smart meters, and these have had many many teething issues. 
            <P>If you do have issues, please do get in touch. At some point I'll set up a web form for you to contact me, but in 
            the meantime, please email guy dot j dot lipman at gmail dot com (replace dot with . and at with @), and let me know the url 
            where you had the problem.

            <H2>Getting my data</H2>
            <P>At the moment if you want to get your data, you will need a smart meter. If you have an account with Octopus Energy, your access key 
            will be the concatenation of your account number (should be something like A-ABCD1234, and appears in the url of the 
            <A HREF="https://octopus.energy/dashboard/" target="_blank">main dashboard</A> when you log in) and your API key 
            (which is a 32 character string and can be found on their <A HREF="https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/" target="blank">developer dashboard</A>).
            If you aren't with Octopus (or even if you are), you can register for a free consumer account with n3rgy by going to their 
            <A HREF="https://www.n3rgy.com/" target="_blank">main website</A> and clicking on the "I'm a Consumer button in the top right corner. 
            In order to authenticate that you have the right to access your account information, you will need to provide n3rgy with 
            your electricity MPAN (which can be found on your latest bill), the MAC code of your in-house display (a 16 character string - leave out the hyphens), and 
            roughly when you moved into your home. Once you are registered with n3rgy, you will be able to access your data using your MAC code. 

            <H2>Suggestions</H2>
            <P>This website is a work in progress, so I would be very open to suggestions of things that would make it a lot more useful.
            In particular, if there are particular views of your data that you'd find useful, please let me know. And if
            you know of ways other than Octopus and n3rgy that customers can access their smart meter data, please let me know. The best way to get
            in touch is by email, on guy dot j dot lipman at gmail dot com (replace dot with . and at with @).

            <H2>The background to this project</H2>
            <P>As a long term energy geek, I was excited to get a smart meter in early 2018. Finally I would be able to know 
            how much electricity I was using, and when. 

            <P>Unfortunately I was quickly disappointed. There was an in-house display, but it didn't show much information, and didn't provide any way to get that data 
            onto my computer. It did save me from manually submitting meter readings, but I didn't entirely trust my supplier, 
            and worried that if anything went wrong I wouldn't have anything to point to.

            <P>Then at the end of 2018, I switched to <A HREF="https://octopus.energy/" target="_blank">Octopus Energy</A>, 
            and one of their big selling points for me was their API that lets customers access their consumption data. They also have 
            a tariff, Agile, which varies every half hour based on market prices. This offers a huge scope for saving, but also a need
            to be able to track all the consumption data and prices.</P>

            <P>Over the past 18 months I have been doing <A HREF="https://www.guylipman.com/octopus/" target="_blank">quite a bit of coding</A>, in both python and javascript, trying to make the best 
            use of the Octopus API. I have been part of a group of like-minded and clever people who are trying to do their bit to make it easier for
            customers <A HREF="https://octopus.energy/blog/agile-smart-home-diy/" target="_blank">to save money and the planet</A>.</P>
            
            <P>Obviously only a minority of smart meter customers are on Octopus, so I have also been thinking a lot
            about how to let other smart meter customers 
            make the most of the data they are collecting. Sure, many people don't want to worry about things like this,
            but if they can't see their data on demand, we can't be surprised when they don't trust the system.</P>
            
            <P>Over the past six months I had many conversations, with Octopus, with the <A HREF="https://serl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Smart Energy Research Lab</A>, 
             <A HREF="https://www.hildebrand.co.uk/" target="blank">
            Hildebrand Technology</A>, <A HREF="https://www.n3rgy.com/" target="_blank">n3rgy</A>,

            Carbon Coop</A> as well as with many smart meter users. 
            I wrote a <A HREF="https://medium.com/@guylipman/letting-people-access-their-electricity-data-e3d36ad9b6c0" target="_blank">blog post</A>
            on the topic, and even presented on my ideas as part of a job interview. </P>
            I finally found myself with a bit of time so I decided to give it a go.</P>

            <P>I'm not entirely sure where this project will go. At the moment I am volunteering my time to this, and 
            it is just hosted on a virtual server for which I'm paying £10/month. But I am still convinced that there are 
            a lot of smart meter customers that would like to know that they could get ready access to their data if they wanted.</P>

    <P>This site is designed to let energy consumers with smart meters access the information 
    that these devices collect in a secure way. I want it to be something that is easy to use, but also gives
    reliable data and useful insights. This page is designed to help you get started as quickly as possible. 
    Initially it is limited to customers of Octopus Energy or those with an n3rgy account (these are free to set up and 
    should work with most UK smart meters). </P>

    <P>If you have questions or suggestions, you can email me on guy.j.lipman &#64; gmail.com (removing the spaces). 
    I do have more features planned, but I will be guided by suggestions from users. I hope you find it useful.</P>
 

    <H4>Loading data for the first time</H4>
    <P>To get started, you want to load some data. 
    <UL>
    <LI> If you are an Octopus Energy customer, click 
    <A HREF="https://energy.guylipman.com/sm/admin?source=octopus" target="_blank">here</A> to enter 
    your security key. </LI>
    <LI>If you have an n3rgy data account (or want to get one - it is free), click 
    <A HREF="https://energy.guylipman.com/sm/admin?source=n3rgy" target="_blank">here</A>.</LI>
    <LI>If you don't have an Octopus or n3rgy account and just want to see the website using electricity consumption data for 
    a made-up user, that is fine. If the url doesn't have any octopus or n3rgy key in it, it will be using the made-up user data.</LI>
    </UL> 
    <P>At this stage the website won't store anything, but will check with Octopus or n3rgy that your key is valid, 
    and let you know what data we can load. If you want then, you can click a button to load electricity consumption data, 
    gas consumption data (if you have it) or electricity export data (if you have it). </P>
    <P>If you click on the Load button, it will load and store the data going back as far as 1 January 2019. You can delete it at any point,
    or I will delete it automatically within 24 hours of you loading it. I don't store your security key, but do create a unique session_id 
    which allows you to access your data for the next hour.</P>

    <H4>Electricity Consumption Data</H4>
    <P>The first page to look at is the consumption charts. These show monthly consumption since 2019, daily consumption for a given month, and half hourly consumption
    for a given day. You can navigate between the different views.</P>
    <P>A useful tip for many of the views: if you want to limit the data that is picked up, you can add a start and end date in the url. For example, 
    &start=2020/01/01&end=2020/03/31 will just show the data for Q1 2020.</P>
    
    <H4>Electricity Cost Data</H4>
    <P>Similarly to electricity consumption, you can see monthly cost since 2019, daily cost for a given month, and half hourly cost for a given day.</P>
    <P>In order to calculate the cost, we need to know your tariff. You can set a fixed tariff (&tariff=15) - this is interpreted as the tariff in p/kwh, 
    including VAT, and excluding any standing charges. Alternatively, you can use a time-varying tariff like Octopus's AGILE-18-02-21, AGILE-FLEX-22-11-25 or GO-18-06-12
    (at the moment these are the only time-varying tariffs I've made available, but I will be adding more later). In order to use the 
    time-varying tariffs, you will also need to include your region code, eg C for London. So for me, I set &tariff=AGILE-18-02-21&amp;region=C. If you aren't sure
    what your region code is, you can find it on the Admin page, or if you leave it off you'll be presented with a list. </P>

    <H4>Carbon Intensity</H4>
    <P>This page allows you to view your average carbon intensity and compare it with what it would have been if you consumed
    with a profile/shape that matched the average UK domestic customer. You can drill down to daily or half-hourly level.</P>
    
    <H4>Electricity Bill Calculator</H4>
    <P>The bill calculator lets you calculate what your bill should have been between two dates. As with the Cost Data, you will need to 
    include either a fixed or time-varying tariff. If fixed, include a price (including VAT). If time-varying, you will need to include
    the region. If you have already set these in the url, it should pick them up automatically. You will also need to 
    include the daily standing charge (including VAT). </P>
    <P>It should be noted that the bill calculated won't be exactly the same as what your supplier calculates, because of rounding of consumption and costs. 
    However, it should get you within a percent or two. If you're out by more please get in touch and I can look into it.</P>

    <H4>Save to CSV</H4>
    <P>This page allows you to generate a csv with your half-hourly consumption, prices and costs, and daily consumption and costs.</P>

    <H4>Gas Data</H4>
    <P>Most of the features for gas consumption data work similarly to electricity consumption data, so make sure you read the sections above.</P>
    <P>For gas, the tariff it uses for calculating cost should be set with &gastariff=3.5 (including VAT, excluding standing charges). The reason 
    This allows you to switch back and forth between electricity and gas without modifying the url parameters. </P>
    <P>You can also use the Octopus Gas Tracker tariff, ie gastariff=SILVER-2017-1, in which case you also need to include your region, 
    eg region=C (your region will by the same for electricity and gas).</P>
    <P>If your meter is SMETS2, the gas consumption data we receive is in cubic metres, not kwh. Unfortunately I can't 
    reliably tell from Octopus or n3rgy whether you are SMETS1 or 2, so I can't adjust it automatically. As a result, if you are SMETS2
    you will need to add a parameter &gasmult=11.19 or something like that. This conversion should be specified on your 
    latest bill, and is made up of a volume correction factor (around 1.02264) multiplied by a calorific value (around 40) divided by
    a kwh conversion factor (3.6). </P>

    <H4>Electricity Export Data</H4>
    <P>Most of the features for electricity export data work similarly to electricity consumption data, so make sure you read the sections above.</P>
    <P>For electricity export, the tariff it uses for calculating is specified with &exporttariff=5.5 (in p/kwh, export tariffs don't have VAT). 
    This allows you to switch back and forth between consumption and export without modifying the url parameters.</P>
    <P>You can also use the Octopus Agile Outgoing tariff, ie exporttariff=AGILE-OUTGOING-19-05-13, in which case you also need to include your region, 
    eg region=C (your region will by the same for consumption and export).</P>

    <H4>Frequently Asked Questions</H4>

    <P><B>Why are there lots of parameters in the URL?</B> You will notice that the url will often contain a number of additional parameters, for example mode, tariffs and 
    your octopus/n3rgy key. I do this to make it easy to see and change assumptions, for you to be able to bookmark particular 
    screens, and also for me to be able to replicate any issues you face.</P> 


    <P><B>What is the mode parameter in the URL?</B> The url should include a mode parameter, which will be a 3 digit code, eg 100. This keeps track of what data we have stored, and therefore
    what options to show you. 100 means we just have your electricity consumption data. 110 means we have electricity and gas consumption data. 101 means we just have 
    electricity consumption and export data. And 111 means we have electricity consumption and export data as well as gas data. If you remove this flag it 
    will reset it automatically. You can modify it manually, but it may lead to you seeing irrelevant options, or missing valid ones.</P>
